-------------------- Report --------------------------------

I unfortunately haven't had the much time to make the assignment, I've made attempt on 2 sub- tasks, but without tests. Thought I know it's no excuse, but many resubmissions in AP came at once,
so I've asked if I can get 1 or 2 more days to do the assignments in PMPH, though since I haven't gotten a answer I'm first delivering this.





task 1a)
made an attempt, but haven't tested.

task 1c)
made an attempt but haven't tested.

task 2a)

Outer loop has a variable dependency of accum, when accum is declared outside of the loop.
Outer loop, as written in the assignment, is parallel, as it has no variabel dependency for B.

No it's sequential. The line 6, accum, has a dependency on itself.

I do not believe it is possible to make it run in parallel, as accum's self dependency blocks.
Maybe, since the J-loop is from 1-63, one could calculate all the values of accum, but since the new value of accum is dependent on tmpA, I still do not believe this is possible.

task 2.c)
Made an attempt, but haven't tested.
