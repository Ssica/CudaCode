Every task except for 3.d as been attempted/made.

I have one problem though, which is that for some reason I cannot call some of my functions, or rather I'm calling them incorrectly and I haven't been able to figure out why.

2.a: 
Outer loop has a variable dependency of accum, when accum is declared outside of the loop.
Outer loop, as written in the assignment, is parallel, as it has no variabel dependency for B.

No it's sequential. The line 6, accum, has a dependency on itself as it takes the sqrt which is not associative.

I do not believe it is possible to make it run in parallel, as accum's self dependency as it takes the sqrt.

If line 6 is rewritten it will be possible to rewrite it to parallel as the operator is associative.
